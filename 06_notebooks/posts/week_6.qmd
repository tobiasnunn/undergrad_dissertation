# Introduction {#seq-week6}

I have finished answering Major Problem 1 relating to data availability. I inevitably concluded that more data is required, an obvious conclusion. However, in answering this through the proper channels, I have constructed the pipeline to process the additional data I require once I can obtain it (that would be a good title for the dissertation). This will require answering Major Problem 2 relating to data processing time. This will take much time, and will be waylaid by the fact next week I am doing a course on data visualisation and after that I have a summer internship. Meaning, it may not be until late August I am able to work on this project again.

# Methods

I began this week by finishing up the write up for "week_5.qmd" and generating the final prototype heatmap. I found last year in ENS-2002 that waiting until the end to write up the portfolio is a bad idea because I end up doing so much I haven't the foggiest what I did 3/4 of a year ago. Thus, I would like to write up "Chapter 1: Constructing a Post-annotation data-manipulation pipeline" (working title) now, while it is fresh. This will be another R.project, however, this one will be an R book. I also aim to simplify and reconstruct the current data pipeline into a more refined format (currently, the whole thing is split between 7 different files, I want 1 for the main pipeline, and possibly another just for making the heatmaps so that if I want to create multiple different heatmaps from the same source, the code file does not get messy). After this is concluded, I will not have time to begin on answering Major Problem 2. In preparation for my data-visualisation course I will be doing a self-taught Python online course. I may write that up here, and treat these more generally as work diaries, more than specifically for ENS-3002 (or whatever the code for the dissertation is).

I started by reworking the data pipeline into the file "00_scripts/R_scripts/02_FULL_HOST_PIPELINE" with the aim of removing unnecessary steps and making better use of the PostgreSQL database.

#### Bacterial diseases of reptiles (<https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781420004038-15/bacterial-diseases-reptiles-elliott-jacobson>)

Aeromonas, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Escherichia, Morganella, Providencia, Pseudomonas, and Salmonella are just a
few of a long list of aerobic bacteria frequently isolated from
ill captive reptiles (Mayer and Frank, 1974; Jacobson, 1984a).

-   good source of information on how to add more data about reptile bacteria, one thing I will say though is that these are pathogenic to reptiles, but I genuinly cannot find any info on symbiotic bacteria for reptiles, so I am going to work with this for now

Names: Aeromonas, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Morganella, Providencia, Pseudomonas

Codes:642, 544, 547, 581, 586, 286

but I do find myself asking "why these genera?", just because they were the first I found that someone once said were likely to have reptile information. This would be good for answering the new Major Problem 3, relating to host taxa availibity. However, I do not want to get confused while making the pipeline, so I think I will waylay this analysis until after I have constructed the pipeline using the 5 genera I already have. This means I can make answering MP3 a proper scientific comparison / analysis. Once the pipeline is setup, it will be ideal for for doing the testing for MP3 as I will be able to quickly analyse a lot of metadata.
