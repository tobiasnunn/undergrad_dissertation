# Introduction {#seq-week4}

This was my final week of assessments, so I didnt get much done. However, at the weekend I did want to do some reading of papers and begin planning what I want the dissertation to look like.

# Methods

In (undergrad_dissertation/06_notebooks/dissertation_plan.pptx) I began looking into what I said the project would be and what I wanted it to look like. I used a powerpoint because I liked the more visual aspect of it, helping me visualise things.

# Results

# Conclusions

# Scientific papers
