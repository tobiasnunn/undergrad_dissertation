One-milliliter aliquots were diluted stepwise to 1:100,000 (sterile seawater), and 100 μl were subsequently plated and incubated (21 d, 28 °C). Seawater samples: One-milliliter seawater was diluted stepwise with 9 ml sterile seawater to 1:1,000. Aliquots of 100 μl were then plated and incubated as described above. Sediment samples: Sediment samples of 1 g were thoroughly mixed with 9 ml sterile seawater (rotary shaker, 170 rpm., 30 min, 25 °C) and then diluted in 1:10 steps with sterile seawater to 1:10,000. Afterwards, 100 μl aliquots were plated. Two media were used for plating, modified 2216E and modified VY/2 medium. Plating was completed within 2 h after sampling. After incubation, colony-forming units were counted with numbers ranging from 10 to 500. Colonies were selected depending on color, size, and shape.

One-milliliter aliquots were diluted stepwise to 1:100,000 (sterile seawater), and 100 μl were subsequently plated and incubated (21 d, 28 °C). Seawater samples: One-milliliter seawater was diluted stepwise with 9 ml sterile seawater to 1:1,000. Aliquots of 100 μl were then plated and incubated as described above.

Afterwards, 100 μl aliquots were plated. Two media were used for plating, modified 2216E and modified VY/2 medium. Plating was completed within 2 h after sampling. After incubation, colony-forming units were counted with numbers ranging from 10 to 500. Colonies were selected depending on color, size, and shape.

Phycosphere bacteria: Macroalgae were cut into pieces and rinsed thrice with sterile seawater. Afterwards, 10 g of these pieces were washed with 10 ml sterile seawater (rotary shaker, 170 rpm., 30 min, 25 °C). One-milliliter aliquots were diluted stepwise to 1:100,000 (sterile seawater), and 100 μl were subsequently plated and incubated (21 d, 28 °C). Seawater samples: One-milliliter seawater was diluted stepwise with 9 ml sterile seawater to 1:1,000. Aliquots of 100 μl were then plated and incubated as described above. Sediment samples: Sediment samples of 1 g were thoroughly mixed with 9 ml sterile seawater (rotary shaker, 170 rpm., 30 min, 25 °C) and then diluted in 1:10 steps with sterile seawater to 1:10,000. Afterwards, 100 μl aliquots were plated. Two media were used for plating, modified 2216E and modified VY/2 medium. Plating was completed within 2 h after sampling. After incubation, colony-forming units were counted with numbers ranging from 10 to 500. Colonies were selected depending on color, size, and shape. Picked colonies were purified by serial cultivation on plates with identical media.

Furthermore, contaminated wastewater stored in tailings dams may pose an environmental threat through the potential for leakage into local groundwater. Microbial communities are often used for biodegradation and environmental remediation, however, little is known about the membership and metabolic potential of SCN-degrading consortia. Application and improvement of the remediation strategy will benefit from an understanding of organisms that can contribute to the breakdown of SCN- into sulfur, carbon and nitrogen compounds. To this end, we performed metagenomic analysis of samples from two laboratory-scale bioreactors used to study SCN- and CN- degradation by established microbial consortia. Community analysis revealed the dominance of Thiobacillus spp. whose genomes harbor a previously unreported operon for SCN- degradation. Metabolic predictions suggest that a large portion of each bioreactor community is autotrophic, relying not on molasses in reactor feed, but using energy gained from oxidation of the sulfur compounds produced during SCN- degradation. Heterotrophs compose a smaller portion of the reactor bacterial community, and predation by phage and eukaryotes is predicted to affect community dynamics. Furthermore, genes for ammonium oxidation and denitrification were detected, possibly allowing removal of nitrogen as required for complete remediation of wastewater.

Surveillance of resistance reservoirs, like the rarely explored oral microbiome, is necessary to combat AMR. We characterised the development of the paediatric oral resistome and investigated its role in dental caries in 221 twin children sampled over the first decade of life. From 535 oral metagenomes, we identified 309 antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), which significantly clustered by age, with the influence of host genetics on antimicrobial resistance increasing over time. Our results suggest the mobilisation potential of ARGs increased with age as Tn916 transposase was co-located with more species and ARGs as children grew.
